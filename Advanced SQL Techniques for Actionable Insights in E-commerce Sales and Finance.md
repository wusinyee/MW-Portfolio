# Advanced SQL Techniques for Actionable Insights in E-commerce Sales and Finance 

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating data stored in databases. While basic SQL commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are suitable for many common use cases, advanced techniques can enable more complex queries and analyses. In this guide, we will explore some of the most popular advanced SQL techniques with a focus on e-commerce sales and finance data.

## 1. Window Functions 
Window functions are useful for identifying trends and patterns in e-commerce sales data. Let's consider an example of using a window function to calculate monthly sales growth rates:

```sql
SELECT month, total_sales,
       LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_sales,
       (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100 AS growth_rate
FROM sales_table;
```

**Explanation:**
- The query retrieves the month and total sales from the 'sales_table'.
- The 'LAG()' function is used with the 'OVER' clause to fetch the total sales for the previous month. This allows us to compare the current month's sales with the previous month's sales.
- We calculate the growth rate by subtracting the previous month's sales from the current month's sales, dividing it by the previous month's sales, and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.
This query helps identify the monthly growth rate of sales, allowing Spring GDS Hong Kong to track performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions on marketing strategies or inventory planning.

## 2. Subqueries

Subqueries are queries within a query. They can be used to retrieve data from one query and use it as input for another query. Subqueries can be powerful tools for performing complex analyses and comparisons in SQL queries.

In the context of e-commerce solution sales and finance for Spring GDS Hong Kong, subqueries can help identify trends, patterns, and make informed decisions based on comparisons and calculations.

**Example:** Fetching the total revenue from e-commerce sales and comparing it with financial targets

```sql
SELECT financial_target, (SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM e-commerce_sales) AS total_revenue
FROM targets_table;
```

**Explanation:**

In this example, the main query selects the financial targets from the `targets_table`. The subquery `(SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM e-commerce_sales)` retrieves the total revenue from the `e-commerce_sales` table. The subquery is executed for each row of the main query, providing the total revenue value.

By comparing the total revenue with the financial targets, Spring GDS Hong Kong can evaluate the performance against set goals. This comparison can help identify whether the revenue aligns with the targets and make informed decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and strategy adjustments.

**Other uses of subqueries:**

* Filtering data based on a subquery's result
* Performing calculations using subquery results
* Using subqueries in JOIN conditions

**Example:** Filtering sales data for specific products based on certain criteria

```sql
SELECT product_name, sales
FROM sales_table
WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM product_table WHERE category = 'Electronics');
```

In this example, the subquery `(SELECT product_id FROM product_table WHERE category = 'Electronics')` retrieves the product IDs for products in the `Electronics` category. The main query then selects the product names and sales for the products that match those IDs.

## 3. Aggregate Functions with Grouping Sets:
   - Example: Generating a sales report by product category and customer segment
   ```sql
   SELECT product_category, customer_segment, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   FROM sales_table
   GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((product_category), (customer_segment));
   ```
   Explanation: This query uses grouping sets to generate a comprehensive sales report that summarizes sales data by product category and customer segment. It provides insights into the performance of different categories and customer segments.

## 4. Advanced Join Techniques:
   - Example: Joining sales data with customer information to analyze customer behavior
   ```sql
   SELECT s.order_id, s.order_date, s.order_amount, c.customer_name
   FROM sales_table s
   INNER JOIN customer_table c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id;
   ```
   Explanation: This query demonstrates an inner join between the `sales_table` and `customer_table` based on the customer ID. By joining these tables, you can analyze sales data alongside customer information to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

   ## 5. Case Statements:
   - Example: Categorizing sales data based on order amount thresholds
   ```sql
   SELECT order_id, order_amount,
          CASE
             WHEN order_amount < 1000 THEN 'Low'
             WHEN order_amount >= 1000 AND order_amount < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
             ELSE 'High'
          END AS sales_category
   FROM sales_table;
   ```
   Explanation: This query uses a case statement to categorize sales data based on different order amount thresholds. It allows you to analyze sales performance across different sales categories and identify trends within each category.

   ## 6. Temporal Queries:
   - Example: Analyzing year-over-year sales growth for a specific period
   ```sql
   SELECT year, SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
          LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_sales,
          (SUM(sales) - LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY year)) / LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY year) * 100 AS growth_rate
   FROM sales_table
   WHERE year BETWEEN 2020 AND 2022
   GROUP BY year;
   ```
   Explanation: This query calculates year-over-year sales growth by comparing the total sales for each year with the previous year's sales. It helps identify growth rates and trends over time.

## 7. Unions and Intersections:
   - Example: Consolidating sales data from multiple sources
   ```sql
   SELECT order_id, order_date, sales
   FROM sales_table_1
   UNION
   SELECT order_id, order_date, sales
   FROM sales_table_2;
   ```
   Explanation: This query combines sales data from `sales_table_1` and `sales_table_2` using the UNION operator. It consolidates sales data from different sources into a single result set for further analysis.

## 8. Views and Materialized Views:
   - Example: Creating a view for frequently used complex queries
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW monthly_revenue AS
   SELECT month, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
   FROM sales_table
   GROUP BY month;
   ```
   Explanation: This query creates a view named `monthly_revenue` that encapsulates the query for calculating monthly revenue. It simplifies querying by allowing you to directly retrieve monthly revenue without having to rewrite the entire query.

## 9. Performance Optimization Techniques:

Optimizing query performance is crucial for complex SQL queries to ensure efficient data retrieval and analysis. By employing various optimization techniques, you can enhance the speed and efficiency of queries, resulting in faster data processing and improved overall performance. In the context of e-commerce solution sales and finance for Spring GDS Hong Kong, optimizing SQL queries can significantly impact decision-making processes and enable timely insights.

**Example techniques for SQL query optimization include:**

1. **Indexing:**
    * Create appropriate indexes on columns used frequently in join conditions, WHERE clauses, or ORDER BY statements.
    * Indexes allow the database engine to locate and retrieve data more efficiently, reducing the need for full table scans.
Example: Creating an index on frequently used columns for faster data retrieval
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_product_category ON sales_table (product_category);
```
Explanation: This query creates an index named idx_product_category on the product_category column of the sales_table. By creating an index on frequently used columns, such as product category, the database engine can locate and retrieve relevant data more efficiently, resulting in faster query execution.

2. **Partitioning:**
    * Partition large tables into smaller, more manageable segments based on specific criteria (e.g., date ranges or product categories).
    * Partitioning can improve query performance by limiting the amount of data scanned during retrieval and reducing contention on disk resources.
Example: Partitioning a large sales table by date range
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_table (
  ...
  order_date DATE,
  ...
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

CREATE TABLE sales_table_q1 PARTITION OF sales_table
FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-04-01');
```
Explanation: This example demonstrates partitioning the sales_table based on the order_date column. By splitting the table into smaller partitions based on date ranges (e.g., quarters), query performance can be improved as the database only needs to scan the relevant partition for a specific time period, rather than the entire table.

3. **Analyzing Query Plans:**
    * Use EXPLAIN or query profiling tools to analyze the query execution plan.
    * Identify any performance bottlenecks, such as full table scans, inefficient join algorithms, or excessive sorting operations.
    * Optimize queries by making adjustments based on the observed execution plan.
Example:Analyzing the execution plan for a complex query
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM sales_table WHERE product_category = 'Electronics';
```
Explanation: By using the EXPLAIN statement, the database engine generates an execution plan for the given query. The execution plan outlines the steps the database will take to retrieve the data. Analyzing the plan helps identify any performance bottlenecks, such as full table scans or inefficient join algorithms. Based on the observed execution plan, optimizations can be made to improve query performance.

4. **Query Rewriting:**
    * Rewrite complex queries to simplify their logic or improve performance.
    * Consider using alternative query structures, rewriting subqueries as joins, or breaking down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
Example: Rewriting a subquery as a join to improve performance
```sql
SELECT s.product_id, s.order_amount, p.product_name
FROM sales_table s
JOIN product_table p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.order_date >= '2023-01-01';
```
Explanation: Instead of using a subquery to retrieve the product_name based on the product_id, this query rewrites the subquery as a join with the product_table. By directly joining the tables, the query eliminates the need for a separate subquery, resulting in improved performance.

5. **Caching:**
    * Utilize caching mechanisms to store query results and avoid repetitive execution.
    * Caching can significantly improve performance for queries that are frequently executed with the same parameters or on static data.
Example: Caching frequently accessed sales data
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_table CACHE;
```
Explanation: By adding the CACHE hint to the query, the database engine caches the result set. Subsequent executions of the same query can then retrieve the data directly from the cache instead of re-executing the entire query. Caching can significantly improve performance for queries that are frequently executed with the same parameters or on static data.

6. **Parameterization:**
    * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid repetitive compilation of query execution plans.
    * Parameterization allows the database engine to reuse compiled plans for similar queries, reducing overhead and improving performance.
7. **Optimized Data Types:**
    * Choose appropriate data types for columns that match the nature of the data being stored.
    * Avoid using excessively large data types when smaller ones are sufficient, as larger data types require more memory and storage.

By employing these optimization techniques, Spring GDS Hong Kong can significantly improve query performance, enabling faster data retrieval and analysis. This, in turn, facilitates timely decision-making, enhances reporting capabilities, and supports the generation of actionable insights based on sales and financial data.

**It's essential to periodically review and fine-tune the optimization strategies as data volumes and usage patterns evolve.** Regularly monitoring query performance and adjusting indexes, partitions, or rewriting queries will ensure ongoing optimization and efficient utilization of the database resources.


## 10. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs are valuable for breaking down complicated queries into simpler, easier-to-handle parts. Let's consider an example where we use a CTE to analyze e-commerce sales by product category and region:

```sql
WITH category_sales AS (
  SELECT product_category, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_table
  GROUP BY product_category
), region_sales AS (
  SELECT region, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_table
  GROUP BY region
)
SELECT cs.product_category, rs.region, cs.total_sales, rs.total_sales
FROM category_sales cs
JOIN region_sales rs ON 1=1;
```

**Explanation:**
-	We create two CTEs: ‘category_sales’ calculates the total sales by product category, and ‘region_sales’ calculates the total sales by region.
-	The main query joins the CTEs based on a dummy condition (1=1) to combine the results.
-	This breakdown allows for separate analysis of sales by product category and sales by region, providing actionable insights into the performance of different product categories and regional markets.
By analyzing sales data using CTEs, Spring GDS Hong Kong can identify top-performing product categories and regions, evaluate marketing strategies, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans.

## **Employee Sales Reporting and Trend Analysis**

CTEs allowed me to structure my queries in a more readable and manageable manner. I could create temporary result sets and call upon them multiple times within the same query. The process of debugging became less daunting, and the overall performance of my queries improved drastically.

With CTEs, here is how I tranform process to efficient pipeline:
- Identify the data requirements
- Structure the CTE
- Test each CTE for accurate results
- Combine all CTEs to generate the final output

You can use SQL to solve complicated real-world problem with 3 foundamental steps:
1. Identify the problem
2. Breakdown the pproblem in to parts for analysis
3. Gather Results and craft solutions

### **Part 1: The Problem**

Despite having a strong sales team, you've noticed an ***unsteady performance pattern in the last few quarters***.

Task: find a way to ***track your sales team's performance over time*** to ***identify the consistent high performers*** and ***those who may be facing challenges***.

### **Part 2: The Breakdown**

Now that the problem is identified and understood, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Create a list of **each employee's total sales per quarter for the past year**.

2. Find a way to **identify the top performers for each quarter**

3. Create the employee sales trend analysis


### **Part 3: The Solution**

In this demonstration, I will create my own database. However, when solving real-world problems, please retrieve the relevant tables from the database.

**Step 1: Setup the database**
```sql

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    role VARCHAR(50),

    department VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
	launch_date DATE,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),
    sale_date DATE,

);

CREATE TABLE sales_targets (
    target_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    quarter INT,
    year INT,
    target DECIMAL(10, 2)

INSERT INTO sales_targets (employee_id, quarter, year, target)
VALUES

(2, 4, 2021, 650),
(3, 1, 2021, 600),
(3, 2, 2021, 800),
(3, 3, 2021, 850),
(3, 4, 2021, 700),
(4, 1, 2021, 580),

(8, 4, 2021, 750);

```
**Step 2: Quick analysis**

```sql
-- First, calculate the sales for each employee for the last quarter of 2021
SELECT employee_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
FROM sales
JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.product_id
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-10-01' AND '2021-12-31'
GROUP BY employee_id
```
**Output**

| employee_id | total_sales |
|---|---|
| 1 | 18000.00 |
| 8 | 1200.00 |
| 13 | 12000.00 |
| 19 | 120.00 |
| 20 | 3750.00 |

Next, let's turn that into a CTE so that we can perform additional analysis on it.

For example, finding the top 5 employees in terms of sales for the last quarter of 2021.

```sql
WITH sales_last_quarter AS (
    SELECT employee_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.product_id
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-10-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT first_name, last_name, total_sales
FROM sales_last_quarter
JOIN employees ON sales_last_quarter.employee_id = employees.employee_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Results**

| first_name | last_name | total_sales |
|---|---|---|
| Lionel | Messie | 18000.00 |
| Rihanna | Finty | 12000.00 |
| Martin | Luther King | 3750.00 |
| Marie | Curious | 1200.00 |
| Mahatma | Gandy | 120.00 |

This clause and result constitutes the base of CTE, which can be used for additional complex analysis.

**Step 3: Quarterly Employee Sales Target Performance Analysis**

With the "base CTE" created, we can perform some more complex analysis, like understanding employee sales performance vs. target on a quarterly basis.

This type of analysis solves many problems:

- It allows managers to see how many employees were able to meet their sales targets.
- This information can be used to assess the effectiveness of the sales strategies used in the last quarter.
- If the number of employees reaching their target is low, the company may need to provide additional training or resources or adjust the targets.
```sql
WITH sales_last_quarter AS (
    SELECT employee_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.product_id
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-10-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY employee_id
),
targets_last_quarter AS (
    SELECT employee_id, target
    FROM sales_targets
    WHERE quarter = 4 AND year = 2021
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as employees_reached_target
FROM sales_last_quarter
JOIN targets_last_quarter ON sales_last_quarter.employee_id = targets_last_quarter.employee_id
WHERE total_sales >= target;
```

**Results**

| employees_reached_target |
| ------------------------ |
| 2                        |

**Step 4: Employee Sales Trend Analysis: Compare Quarterly Performance vs. Annual Performance**

Finally, we can create a comparison of the quarterly sales performance against the entire year's sales performance to understand trends.

*Notice we have a new CTE that calculates the Q4 2021 targets.*

We use both CTEs to calculate the difference and then sort the results by that difference.
```sql
WITH sales_last_quarter AS (
    SELECT employee_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.product_id
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2021-10-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY employee_id
),
yearly_avg_sales AS (
    SELECT employee_id, AVG(quantity * price) AS avg_sales
    FROM sales
    JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.product_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2021
    GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT E.first_name, E.last_name, LQ.total_sales AS q4_sales, YAS.avg_sales AS yearly_avg_sales,
       (LQ.total_sales - YAS.avg_sales) / YAS.avg_sales * 100 AS percent_difference
FROM sales_last_quarter LQ
JOIN yearly_avg_sales YAS ON LQ.employee_id = YAS.employee_id
JOIN employees E ON LQ.employee_id = E.employee_id
ORDER BY percent_difference DESC;
```

**Results**

| first_name | last_name   | q4_sales | yearly_avg_sales      | percent_difference      |

### Summary

1. Utilize SQL CTEs to structure and simplify complex queries.
2. Created tables, inserted data, and leveraged this data to derive meaningful insights.
3. Use CTEs to calculate total sales, analyze quarterly performance, and compare it with the yearly average for each sales representative.
4. Gained a practical understanding of how to use CTEs to identify top-performing employees and track sales trends.
5. SQL can help turn raw sales data into actionable insights that can drive business growth and inform strategic decisions.


## 3. Recursive Queries
Recursive queries can help break down complex financial data into actionable insights. Let's consider an example where we use a recursive query to calculate the cumulative revenue for each quarter:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE quarterly_revenue AS (
  SELECT quarter, SUM(revenue) AS cumulative_revenue
  FROM financial_data
  WHERE quarter = 'Q1'
  GROUP BY quarter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT f.quarter, f.revenue + qr.cumulative_revenue
  FROM financial_data f
  JOIN quarterly_revenue qr ON f.quarter = CONCAT('Q', CAST(SUBSTRING(qr.quarter, 2) AS INT) + 1)
)
SELECT quarter, cumulative_revenue
FROM quarterly_revenue;
```

**Explanation:**
-	The initial part of the recursive CTE selects the first quarter ('Q1') and calculates the sum of revenue for that quarter.
-	The recursive part of the CTE joins the ‘financial_data’ table with the ‘quarterly_revenue’ CTE, adding the revenue of the previous quarter to the cumulative revenue.
-	The main query selects the quarter and cumulative revenue from the ‘quarterly_revenue’ CTE.
This recursive query allows a business to track the cumulative revenue for each quarter, identify revenue growth trends, and make informed decisions about budgeting, investment strategies, and resource allocation.

By utilizing these advanced SQL techniques, the business can identify trends and patterns in e-commerce sales and financial data, break down complex queries into manageable parts, and generate actionable insights. These insights can drive informed decision-making, such as adjusting marketing strategies, focusing on high-performing product categories or regions, allocating resources effectively, and setting achievable financial targets.
