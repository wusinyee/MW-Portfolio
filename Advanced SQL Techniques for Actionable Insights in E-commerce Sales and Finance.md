# Advanced SQL Techniques for Actionable Insights in E-commerce Sales and Finance 

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating data stored in databases. While basic SQL commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are suitable for many common use cases, advanced techniques can enable more complex queries and analyses. In this guide, we will explore some of the most popular advanced SQL techniques with a focus on e-commerce sales and finance data.

## 1. Window Functions 
Window functions are useful for identifying trends and patterns in e-commerce sales data. Let's consider an example of using a window function to calculate monthly sales growth rates:

```sql
SELECT month, total_sales,
       LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_sales,
       (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100 AS growth_rate
FROM sales_table;
```

**Explanation:**
- The query retrieves the month and total sales from the 'sales_table'.
- The 'LAG()' function is used with the 'OVER' clause to fetch the total sales for the previous month. This allows us to compare the current month's sales with the previous month's sales.
- We calculate the growth rate by subtracting the previous month's sales from the current month's sales, dividing it by the previous month's sales, and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.
This query helps identify the monthly growth rate of sales, allowing Spring GDS Hong Kong to track performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions on marketing strategies or inventory planning.


## 2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs are valuable for breaking down complicated queries into simpler, easier-to-handle parts. Let's consider an example where we use a CTE to analyze e-commerce sales by product category and region:

```sql
WITH category_sales AS (
  SELECT product_category, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_table
  GROUP BY product_category
), region_sales AS (
  SELECT region, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_table
  GROUP BY region
)
SELECT cs.product_category, rs.region, cs.total_sales, rs.total_sales
FROM category_sales cs
JOIN region_sales rs ON 1=1;
```

**Explanation:**
-	We create two CTEs: ‘category_sales’ calculates the total sales by product category, and ‘region_sales’ calculates the total sales by region.
-	The main query joins the CTEs based on a dummy condition (1=1) to combine the results.
-	This breakdown allows for separate analysis of sales by product category and sales by region, providing actionable insights into the performance of different product categories and regional markets.
By analyzing sales data using CTEs, Spring GDS Hong Kong can identify top-performing product categories and regions, evaluate marketing strategies, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans.


## 3. Recursive Queries
Recursive queries can help break down complex financial data into actionable insights. Let's consider an example where we use a recursive query to calculate the cumulative revenue for each quarter:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE quarterly_revenue AS (
  SELECT quarter, SUM(revenue) AS cumulative_revenue
  FROM financial_data
  WHERE quarter = 'Q1'
  GROUP BY quarter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT f.quarter, f.revenue + qr.cumulative_revenue
  FROM financial_data f
  JOIN quarterly_revenue qr ON f.quarter = CONCAT('Q', CAST(SUBSTRING(qr.quarter, 2) AS INT) + 1)
)
SELECT quarter, cumulative_revenue
FROM quarterly_revenue;
```

**Explanation:**
-	The initial part of the recursive CTE selects the first quarter ('Q1') and calculates the sum of revenue for that quarter.
-	The recursive part of the CTE joins the ‘financial_data’ table with the ‘quarterly_revenue’ CTE, adding the revenue of the previous quarter to the cumulative revenue.
-	The main query selects the quarter and cumulative revenue from the ‘quarterly_revenue’ CTE.
This recursive query allows a business to track the cumulative revenue for each quarter, identify revenue growth trends, and make informed decisions about budgeting, investment strategies, and resource allocation.

By utilizing these advanced SQL techniques, the business can identify trends and patterns in e-commerce sales and financial data, break down complex queries into manageable parts, and generate actionable insights. These insights can drive informed decision-making, such as adjusting marketing strategies, focusing on high-performing product categories or regions, allocating resources effectively, and setting achievable financial targets.
