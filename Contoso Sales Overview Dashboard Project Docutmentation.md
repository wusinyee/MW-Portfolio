# Project Proposal: **Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard Project**

## I. Overview
  Contoso, a fictional electronics retail company, is interested in viewing sales performance information, such as whether sales amounts are on or off target and how certain channels, such as online stores and resellers, compare with each other. The company aims to improve its decision-making processes by implementing a sales analytics dashboard. The dashboard will provide stakeholders with a real-time view of sales metrics to enable data-driven decisions.
  
  Using the Power BI April 2023 Updated version and online design tool Figma, Contoso has decided to implement a Sales dashboard to provide users across the organization with the information they need. 
  
 The Sales dashboard will include a variety of reports, arranged in two or more dashboard pages. The dashboard described in this document is similar to the following image:
