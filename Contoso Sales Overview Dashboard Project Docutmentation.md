# Project Proposal: **Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard Project**

## i. Overview
Contoso, a fictional electronics retail company, would like to track and evaluate its sales performance, and has set the goal of improving its decision-making processes by implementing a sales analytics dashboard. The dashboard will provide stakeholders with a real-time view of sales metrics to enable data-driven decisions.

Here are some screenshots of the dashboard during the early stages of developement:

## ii. Prerequisites
- Power BI free license
- Power BI Desktop
- Contoso sample database
- Figma online free versiom

## iii. Objectives
- [ ] Prepare Dashboard, Business, and Funtional Requirement Documents
- [ ] Improve decision-making processes by providing stakeholders with real-time sales metrics
- [ ] Optimize sales performance by identifying trends and patterns in sales data
- [ ] Increase sales revenue by driving deep into product popularity, key influencers, closing percentage, and top segments
- [ ] Extract valuable insights and generate actionalable items

## iv. Scope:
The scope of the project will include the design and development of a sales analytics dashboard using Power BI and Figma. The dashboard will integrate data from Micrsoft Learning Centre. 
The dashboard will include the following features and functionality:
1. Sales data: The dashboard will provide an overview of sales data such as revenue, profit, and sales by region and product
2. Revenue sources breakdown: The dashboard will breakdown the various sources of revenue.
3. Sales team performance: The dashboard will display metrics related to the sales team's performance such as sales quota attainment, pipeline metrics, and deal velocity.
4. Data Visualization: The dashboard will use charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the data and make it easy for users to interpret.
5. Data Filters: The dashboard will provide filters to allow users to view the data by region, product, or other criteria.

## v. Project Phases
1. Initiation Phase: During this phase, I will work on the Contoso database and prepare the data. I wil also prepare the assoicated documentations (DRD, BRD, and FRD).
2. Design/ Conceptualization Phase: During this phase,I will define the some key KPIs, metrics and design the dashboard wireframes using Figma.
3. Development Phase: During this phase, the dashboard's visuals will be created and arranged. Filters will be created while some AI features in Power BI will be explored.
4. Implementation Phase: During this phase, a funtional dashboard will be ready. A simple user manual of the sales analytics dashboard will be preapred for the users. 
5. Testing Phase: A test plan will be formulated to test the dashboard's functionality, and an evaluation or feedback report will be provided as the final phase of the project. 

### vi. Timeline:
The estimated timeline for the project is as follows:
- [ ] 1. Initiation Phase: 5 days (23/04/2023 to 27/04/2023)
- [ ] 2. Design/ Conceptualization Phase: 5 days (29/04/2023 to 03/05/2023)
- [ ] 3. Development Phase: 1 week (04/05/2023 to 10/05/2023)
- [ ] 4. Implementation Phase: 3 days (11/05/2023 to 13/05/2023)
- [ ] 5. Testing Phase: 5 days (14/05/2023 to 18/05/2023)
Estimate project duration: 25 days

## vii. Deliverables
The deliverables for the Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard Project will include the following:
- [ ] PDF version of the sales analytics dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard Requirement Document (DRD): This document will outline the business requirements and technical specifications for the sales analytics dashboard. It will provide a detailed explanation of the user requirements, the dashboard's features and functionality, and the technical specifications for the dashboard's development. The DRD will serve as a blueprint for the dashboard's development and will be used to ensure that the dashboard meets the business needs and requirements
- [ ] Business Requirement Document (BRD): This document will provide an overview of the project's business requirements. It will describe the business objectives, scope, and constraints for the project. The BRD will also define the project's stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities. The BRD will be used to ensure that the project aligns with the company's overall business goals and objectives.
- [ ] Functional Requirement Document (FRD): This document will describe the functional requirements for the sales analytics dashboard. It will specify the dashboard's features, functionality, and user interface. The FRD will provide a detailed description of the dashboard's functional requirements and will be used to ensure that the dashboard meets the user's needs and expectations. In addition, a section of this document will be dedicated to data modeling and DAX.

## viii. Conclusion
[To be updated] The Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard project aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights to enable data-driven decisions. The dashboard will be designed and developed using Power BI and Figma, integrating data from MS Learning Centre, and providing features such as sales analytics, insales team performance, and marketing analytics. The project will be completed in five phases, including initiation, design, development, implementation and testing.
