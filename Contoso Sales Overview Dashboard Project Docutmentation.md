# Project Proposal: **Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard Project**

## I. Overview
Contoso, a fictional electronics retail company, is seeking to track and evaluate its sales performance and improve its decision-making processes by implementing a sales analytics dashboard. The dashboard will provide stakeholders with a real-time view of sales metrics to enable data-driven decisions.

Here are some screenshots of the dashboard during the early stages of developement:

- [ ] Optimize sales performance by identifying trends and patterns in sales data
- [ ] Increase sales revenue by driving deep into product popularity, key influencers, closing percentage, and top segments
- [ ] Extract valuable insights and generate actionalable items

## IV. Scope:
The scope of the project will include the design and development of a sales analytics dashboard using Power BI and Figma. The dashboard will integrate data from Microsoft Resources. It will include the following features and functionality:
* Sales data overview, such as revenue, profit, and sales by region and product
* Revenue sources breakdown
* Sales team performance metrics, such as sales quota attainment, pipeline metrics, and deal velocity
* Data visualization using charts, graphs, and tables to make it easy for users to interpret
* Data filters to allow users to view data by region, product, or other criteria
* Explore AI usuals such as Key Influencers, Decomposition Tree, and Anomaly Detection

## V. Project Phases
The project will be broken down into five phases:
1. Initiation Phase: Work on the Contoso datasets, prepare data, and associated documentation (DRD, BRD, and FRD)
2. Design/ Conceptualization Phase: Define key KPIs and metrics, design dashboard wireframes using Figma
3. Development Phase: Create and arrange the dashboard's visuals, create filters, and explore AI features in Power BI
4. Implementation Phase: Create a functional dashboard and prepare a simple user manual for users
5. Testing Phase: Formulate a test plan to test the dashboard's functionality, provide an evaluation or feedback report as the final phase of the project

### VI. Timeline:
The estimated timeline for the project is as follows:
- [ ] 1. Initiation Phase: 5 days (23/04/2023 to 27/04/2023)
- [ ] 2. Design/ Conceptualization Phase: 5 days (29/04/2023 to 03/05/2023)
- [ ] 3. Development Phase: 1 week (04/05/2023 to 10/05/2023)
- [ ] 4. Implementation Phase: 3 days (11/05/2023 to 13/05/2023)
- [ ] 5. Testing Phase: 5 days (14/05/2023 to 18/05/2023)
Estimate project duration: 25 days

## VII. Deliverables
The deliverables for the Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard Project will include the following:
- [ ] PDF version of the sales analytics dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard Requirement Document (DRD): This document will outline the business requirements and technical specifications for the sales analytics dashboard. It will provide a detailed explanation of the user requirements, the dashboard's features and functionality, and the technical specifications for the dashboard's development. The DRD will serve as a blueprint for the dashboard's development and will be used to ensure that the dashboard meets the business needs and requirements
- [ ] Business Requirement Document (BRD): This document will provide an overview of the project's business requirements. It will describe the business objectives, scope, and constraints for the project. The BRD will also define the project's stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities. The BRD will be used to ensure that the project aligns with the company's overall business goals and objectives.
- [ ] Functional Requirement Document (FRD): This document will describe the functional requirements for the sales analytics dashboard. It will specify the dashboard's features, functionality, and user interface. The FRD will provide a detailed description of the dashboard's functional requirements and will be used to ensure that the dashboard meets the user's needs and expectations. In addition, a section of this document will be dedicated to data modeling and DAX.

## viii. Conclusion
[To be updated] The Contoso Sales Analytics Dashboard project aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights to enable data-driven decisions. The project will be completed in five phases, including initiation, design, development, implementation, and testing. The project will be completed in five phases, including initiation, design, development, implementation and testing.

# Phase 1: Initiation
Tasks:
- [x] Work on the Contoso database and prepare the data
- [ ] Business Requirement Document
- [ ] Dashboard Requirement Document
- [ ] Functional Requirement Document

## Getting the Contoso database and prepare the data

1. Visting [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/) and navigate to [Get samples for Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-datasets)
2. Follow the instructions on the sample dataset page and retreive the Contoso dataset. 
3. Import the dataset into Power BI. 
4. Make sure the data model is understood, and the relationships between tables are defined. Check for and correct any missing or incomplete data.
5. Identify and remove redundant data; create new variables or derived metrics based on existing data.
6. Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data, if there is any missing data or data imputation, please record it for future reference.
