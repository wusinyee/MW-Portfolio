# Project Title: Customer Sales Trend Analysis with PosgreSQL

### 1. Project Overview: <br>
The purpose of this project is to develop a sales trend analysis system using SQL. The system will enable sales leaders and analysts to gain valuable insights from sales data, predict future trends, make informed decisions, and identify growth opportunities. The project will involve setting up a database, analyzing monthly sales trends, performing sales representative analysis, customer analysis, and product analysis.

### 2. Project Objectives:
*	Provide a comprehensive sales trend analysis solution using SQL.
*	Enable sales leaders to understand sales data and make data-driven decisions.
*	Predict future sales trends with accuracy and confidence.
*	Identify and address potential issues in sales performance.
*	Improve overall business operations and competitiveness.

### 3.	Project Deliverables:
*	A functional database for storing sales data, including tables for Customers, Products, and Sales.
*	SQL queries to perform monthly sales trend analysis, sales representative analysis, customer analysis, and product analysis.
*	Documentation and instructions for setting up the database and executing the SQL queries.
*	A detailed guide on using SQL for sales trend analysis, including sample code and explanations.
*	Training materials to help sales leaders and analysts learn SQL and utilize the analysis system effectively.

### 4.	Stakeholders:
*	Sales leaders: The primary beneficiaries of the sales trend analysis system, responsible for making strategic decisions based on the insights provided.
*	Sales analysts: Users of the system who will execute the SQL queries and interpret the results to provide actionable recommendations.
*	Database administrators: Responsible for setting up and maintaining the database infrastructure.
*	Project manager: Oversees the project's progress, ensures timely delivery of deliverables, and coordinates with stakeholders.

### 5.	Project Approach:
*	Database setup: Create a database with tables for Customers, Products, and Sales, as specified in the provided code.
*	Monthly sales trend analysis: Develop SQL queries to calculate total sales for each month and present the results in an ordered format.
*	Sales representative analysis: Create SQL queries to analyze sales performance by region, grouping sales data based on the sales representative's region.
*	Customer analysis: Design SQL queries to identify top customers based on total revenue generated, providing insights into customer contribution.
*	Product analysis: Develop SQL queries to determine the highest revenue-generating products, helping identify successful product lines.

### 6.	Project Timeline:
*	Database setup: 1 day
*	Monthly sales trend analysis: 2 days
*	Sales representative analysis: 2 days
*	Customer analysis: 2 days
*	Product analysis: 2 days
*	Documentation and guide creation: 2 days
Total estimated project duration: 11 days

### 7.	Risks and Challenges:
*	Data quality: Incomplete or inaccurate sales data may affect the accuracy of the analysis results. Steps should be taken to ensure data integrity.
*	Technical proficiency: Users may require training and support to effectively execute SQL queries and interpret the results.
*	Scope creep: Additional analysis requirements or modifications to the existing queries may arise, requiring proper scope management.
