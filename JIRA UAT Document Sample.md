As an IT project manager, I want to use JIRA to manage UAT remotely so that our team can efficiently perform testing and track issues while working from different locations.

User Story:
As a project manager, I want to create UAT tasks in JIRA so that remote team members can view, track and execute them. The UAT tasks should be created with a clear description, acceptance criteria, and priority level, and should be assigned to the relevant team members.
Additionally, I want to create a UAT dashboard in JIRA that displays the status of all UAT tasks and any issues identified during testing. This will enable me to monitor progress and address any issues that arise during the testing phase.
I also want to be able to communicate with team members directly within JIRA through comments and notifications to ensure everyone is on the same page and can collaborate efficiently.
Lastly, I want to generate UAT reports in JIRA that provide insights into the testing progress, issues found, and any changes made during the process. This will help me make data-driven decisions and provide stakeholders with updates on the UAT status, even while working remotely.
