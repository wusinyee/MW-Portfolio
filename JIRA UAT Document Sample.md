Project Requirement Document
Initiation of JIRA UAT Project

Introduction:
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements and objectives for the initiation of the JIRA UAT Project. This project aims to enable remote team members to perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) efficiently, and to track issues effectively.

Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are:

To use JIRA as the platform to manage UAT remotely.
To create UAT tasks in JIRA with a clear description, acceptance criteria, and priority level, and to assign them to relevant team members.
To develop a UAT dashboard in JIRA that displays the status of all UAT tasks and any issues identified during testing.
To allow direct communication between team members within JIRA through comments and notifications to ensure efficient collaboration.
To generate UAT reports in JIRA that provide insights into the testing progress, issues found, and any changes made during the process.
To ensure all UAT tasks are completed before releasing the final product.
Scope of the Project:
The scope of the project includes the following:

Implementation of JIRA software for UAT.
Creation of UAT tasks with a clear description, acceptance criteria, and priority level.
Assignment of UAT tasks to relevant team members.
