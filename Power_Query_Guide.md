    * Filtering Data
        * Select a column.
        * Use the filter options in the column header or the **Filter Rows** option in the ribbon.
        * For example, to filter for customers from California, you would:

            1. Click the **Filter Rows** option in the ribbon.
            2. In the **Filter by column** box, select **Order Value**.
            3. In the **Filter by value** box, type `>100`.
    * Sorting Data

            1. Select the **Customer Name** column.
            2. Click the **Remove Duplicates** option in the ribbon.
    * Renaming Columns
        * Right-click on a column header.
        * Choose Rename and provide a new name.
        * For example, to rename the **Customer Name** column to **Customer**, you would:

    * Data Type Conversion
        * Select a column.
        * Use the Data Type dropdown in the ribbon to change data types.
        * For example, to change the **Order Value** column from text to numeric, you would:
            1. Select the **Order Value** column.
            2. In the Data Type dropdown, select **Number**.
    * Data Cleanup
        * Handling Missing Values
            * Use the Replace Values option to replace null or missing values.
            * For example, to replace all missing values in the **Order Value** column with the value 0, you would:
                1. Click the **Replace Values** option in the ribbon.
                2. In the **Replace** box, type `null`.
                3. In the **With** box, type `0`.
        * Text and Date Manipulation
            * Use functions like Text.From, Date.FromText, or Text.PadStart to manipulate text and date columns.
            * For example, to convert the **Order Date** column to a date format, you would use the following function:
                ```
                Text.From(Order Date, "YYYY-MM-DD")
                
        * Splitting and Combining Columns
            * Use Split Column or Merge Columns options for splitting or combining data.
            * For example, to split the **Customer Name** column into two columns, one for the first name and one for the last name, you would use the following function:
                
                Split(Customer Name, " ")
                
        * Case Transformation
            * Use functions like Text.Upper, Text.Lower, or Text.Proper to change text case.
            * For example, to convert all text in the **Customer Name** column to uppercase, you would use the following function:
                
                Text.Upper(Customer Name)
                ```

## Advanced Transformation

* Pivot and Unpivot Data
    * Use Pivot Column or Unpivot Columns to reshape your data.
    * For example, to pivot the **Order Details** table so that each product is in a separate column, you would use the following steps:
        * Click the **Pivot Column** button in the ribbon.
        * Select the **Order Details** table.
        * In the **Pivot Column** dialog box, select the **Product Name** column as the column to pivot.
        * Click OK.
    * To unpivot the data, you would use the following steps:
        * Click the **Unpivot Columns** button in the ribbon.
        * Select the **Order Details** table.
        * In the **Unpivot Columns** dialog box, select the **Product Name** column as the column to unpivot.
        * Click OK.
* Grouping and Aggregating Data
    * Use the Group By option to create summary statistics.
    * For example, to group the **Order Details** table by product and calculate the total order value for each product, you would use the following steps:
        * Click the **Group By** button in the ribbon.
        * Select the **Order Details** table.
        * In the **Group By** dialog box, select the **Product Name** column as the column to group by.
        * Click OK.
    * The **Group By** dialog box will show you the available aggregation functions. You can select the aggregation function you want to use for each column.
* Conditional Column Creation
    * Create custom columns with conditional logic using the Add Conditional Column feature.
    * For example, to create a column that indicates whether an order is above or below the average order value, you would use the following steps:
        * Click the **Add Conditional Column** button in the ribbon.
        * In the **Add Conditional Column** dialog box, select the **Order Value** column as the column to condition on.
        * In the **Value if True** box, type the text `Above Average`.
        * In the **Value if False** box, type the text `Below Average`.
        * Click OK.
* Merging Queries
    * Combine multiple queries using Merge Queries or Append Queries.
    * For example, to merge the **Order Details** table with the **Customers** table, you would use the following steps:
        * Create two separate queries for the **Order Details** table and the **Customers** table.
        * Click the **Merge Queries** button in the ribbon.
        * In the **Merge Queries** dialog box, select the two queries you want to merge.
        * Click OK.
    * The **Merge Queries** dialog box will show you the available merge options. You can select the merge option you want to use.
