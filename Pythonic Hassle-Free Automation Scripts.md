## 1. Data extraction and preparation


"Data extraction and preparation" involves the following key steps:

Designing a Dataset Schema with Mockaroo:

Utilize Mockaroo to create a structured dataset schema.
Define the data fields, their data types, and any specific constraints.
Mockaroo generates synthetic data that adheres to this schema, simulating real-world data.
Data Extraction:

Retrieve the synthetic dataset generated by Mockaroo.
Download the dataset in a suitable format, such as CSV or JSON, for further analysis.
Meticulous Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Inspect the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
Apply cleaning operations like removing duplicates, handling missing data, and correcting errors.
Transform data as needed, such as converting data types or reformatting columns.
Ensure data adheres to a consistent and high-quality standard to facilitate accurate analysis.
