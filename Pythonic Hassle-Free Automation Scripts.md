# Pythonic Hassle-Free Automation Scripts

The benevolent Python emerges as a veritable savior, graciously bestowing the gift of automation upon beleaguered analysts. Behold, in a place where time is money and efficiency is paramount, Python automation unfurls its cape in ten distinguished scenarios:

## 1. Data extraction automation scripts

Developing an optimal Python automation script for extracting data from a MySQL database encompasses efficient data retrieval, appropriate error handling, and a well-organized, maintainable code structure. 

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

def extract_data(host, user, password, database, query):
    try:
        # Create a connection to the MySQL database using a context manager
        with mysql.connector.connect(
            host=host,
            user=user,
            password=password,
            database=database
        ) as connection:
            # Create a cursor using a context manager
            with connection.cursor() as cursor:
                # Execute the SQL query and fetch data into a Pandas DataFrame
                cursor.execute(query)
                columns = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]
                data = cursor.fetchall()

        # Create a DataFrame from the fetched data
        df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
        return df

    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        print(f"Error: {err}")
        return None

def test_extract_data():
    # Replace with your test MySQL server details and query
    test_host = "your_test_host"
    test_user = "your_test_user"
    test_password = "your_test_password"
    test_database = "your_test_database"
    test_query = "SELECT * FROM your_test_table"

    # Extract test data
    test_data = extract_data(test_host, test_user, test_password, test_database, test_query)

    # Check if data extraction was successful
    assert test_data is not None, "Data extraction failed"

    # Check if the DataFrame has rows
    assert not test_data.empty, "DataFrame is empty"

    print("Test passed. Data extracted successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with your MySQL server details and query
    host = "your_host"
    user = "your_user"
    password = "your_password"
    database = "your_database"
    query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"

    # Extract data
    extracted_data = extract_data(host, user, password, database, query)

    if extracted_data is not None:
        # Process the data or save it as needed
        print(extracted_data.head())

        # You can perform further data processing or save the data to a file here

    # Run the test function
    test_extract_data()
```
This script utilizes context managers for improved resource management and incorporates a test_extract_data function to verify the accuracy of the data extraction. Replace the test MySQL server details with your own for testing.
To use the script:
1. Replace the placeholders for your MySQL server details and query.
2. Execute the script. The data will be extracted and printed from the MySQL database, followed by the execution of the test function to verify correctness.

## 2. Report generation

The following script generates an Excel report from a DataFrame. To ensure it has no bugs and optimized performance, a test function will be added to verify its correctness.

```python
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.utils.dataframe import dataframe_to_rows
from openpyxl.styles import Font

def generate_excel_report(df, output_file):
    # Create a new Excel workbook
    workbook = Workbook()
    excel_writer = pd.ExcelWriter(output_file, engine="openpyxl")
    excel_writer.book = workbook

    # Create worksheets for PRODUCT REVENUE and REVENUE BREAKDOWN
    product_revenue_sheet = workbook.active
    product_revenue_sheet.title = "PRODUCT REVENUE"

    revenue_breakdown_sheet = workbook.create_sheet(title="REVENUE BREAKDOWN")

    # Define the data for PRODUCT REVENUE
    product_revenue_data = df[["PRODUCT NAME", "COST PER ITEM", "MARKUP PERCENTAGE", "TOTAL SOLD",
                                "TOTAL REVENUE", "SHIPPING CHARGE PER ITEM", "SHIPPING COST PER ITEM",
                                "PROFIT PER ITEM", "RETURNS", "TOTAL INCOME"]]

    # Add headers to the PRODUCT REVENUE sheet
    headers = product_revenue_data.columns.tolist()
    product_revenue_sheet.append(headers)

    # Add data to the PRODUCT REVENUE sheet
    for row in dataframe_to_rows(product_revenue_data, index=False, header=False):
        product_revenue_sheet.append(row)

    # Add headers and percentage data to the REVENUE BREAKDOWN sheet
    revenue_breakdown_headers = ["", "ITEM 1", "ITEM 2", "ITEM 3", "ITEM 4", "ITEM 5", "ITEM 6", "ITEM 7", "ITEM 8", "ALL"]
    revenue_breakdown_sheet.append(revenue_breakdown_headers)

    percentage_data = ["TOTAL REVENUE"] + ["#DIV/0!" for _ in range(9)]
    revenue_breakdown_sheet.append(percentage_data)

    # Apply styling (optional)
    for row in revenue_breakdown_sheet.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=1):
        for cell in row:
            cell.font = Font(bold=True)

    # Save the Excel file
    excel_writer.save()
    excel_writer.close()

    print(f"Excel report generated successfully and saved as '{output_file}'.")

def test_generate_excel_report():
    # Create a sample DataFrame (you can replace this with your actual data)
    sample_data = {
        "PRODUCT NAME": ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"],
        "COST PER ITEM": [10, 15, 12],
        "MARKUP PERCENTAGE": [20, 25, 18],
        "TOTAL SOLD": [100, 150, 120],
        "TOTAL REVENUE": [2000, 3750, 2160],
        "SHIPPING CHARGE PER ITEM": [5, 7, 6],
        "SHIPPING COST PER ITEM": [2, 3, 2.5],
        "PROFIT PER ITEM": [13, 17, 13.5],
        "RETURNS": [5, 2, 3],
        "TOTAL INCOME": [1995, 3748, 2156.5]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)

    # Generate the Excel report for testing
    test_output_file = "test_sales_tracking_report.xlsx"
    generate_excel_report(df, test_output_file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test the generate_excel_report function
    test_generate_excel_report()
```

In this script:

1. The report generation logic was encapsulated into a function called "generate_excel_report."
2. A test function, named test_generate_excel_report, has been implemented to generate a sample Excel report specifically for testing purposes. When conducting tests, it is possible to replace the sample data with the actual data that is being used.
3. The test function generates an Excel report containing a test DataFrame and verifies the successful execution.

To conduct the script testing, execute it. The program will generate an Excel report sample and display a success message. It is important to ensure that the required libraries, such as pandas and openpyxl, are installed.

## 3. Proofread

To automate proofreading for a Word file using the `GingerIt` library in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `gingerit` library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install gingerit-py3
```

2. Create a Python script to read a Word document, extract text, and perform proofreading using `GingerIt`. Here's an example script:

```python
from docx import Document
from gingerit.gingerit import GingerIt

# Load the Word document
def load_docx(filename):
    doc = Document(filename)
    text = [p.text for p in doc.paragraphs]
    return "\n".join(text)

# Perform proofreading
def proofread_document(doc_text):
    parser = GingerIt()
    result = parser.parse(doc_text)

    corrected_text = result['result']
    corrections = result['corrections']

    return corrected_text, corrections

# Replace text in the document with corrected text
def replace_text_in_document(filename, corrected_text):
    doc = Document(filename)
    for paragraph, corrected_paragraph in zip(doc.paragraphs, corrected_text.split('\n')):
        paragraph.clear()  # Clear the existing content
        paragraph.add_run(corrected_paragraph)  # Add the corrected content

    doc.save('corrected_document.docx')

# Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_filename = 'your_document.docx'  # Replace with your Word document file
    doc_text = load_docx(input_filename)

    corrected_text, corrections = proofread_document(doc_text)

    # Print corrections (optional)
    for original, corrected in corrections:
        print(f"Original: {original}, Corrected: {corrected}")

    # Save the corrected text to a new document
    replace_text_in_document(input_filename, corrected_text)
    print("Proofreading completed. Corrected document saved as 'corrected_document.docx'")
```

This script defines three functions:

- `load_docx`: Loads the content of a Word document.
- `proofread_document`: Uses `GingerIt` to perform proofreading and obtain corrections.
- `replace_text_in_document`: Replaces the text in the original document with the corrected text and saves it as 'corrected_document.docx'.

Replace `'your_document.docx'` with the path to your Word document. When you run this script, it will proofread the document, print the corrections (optional), and save the corrected document as 'corrected_document.docx'.

## 4. Data Preperation 
The development of an optimal Python automation script for data preparation encompasses the efficient cleaning, transformation, and organization of data. In order to guarantee error-free and optimized data preparation, we will present a fundamental illustration of the data preparation process, accompanied by a test function to assess its accuracy. It should be noted that the process of data preparation can vary significantly depending on the specific dataset and requirements. Therefore, the following example is a simplified representation.

The following is the script:
```python
import pandas as pd

def prepare_data(input_file, output_file):
    try:
        # Read the input data into a DataFrame
        data = pd.read_csv(input_file)

        # Data cleaning and transformation (sample, replace with your specific logic)
        # Example: Remove rows with missing values and convert a column to datetime
        data.dropna(inplace=True)
        data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

        # Data organization (sample, replace with your specific logic)
        # Example: Sort data by a column and reset the index
        data = data.sort_values(by='Date').reset_index(drop=True)

        # Save the prepared data to an output file (e.g., CSV)
        data.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

        print(f"Data preparation completed. Prepared data saved as '{output_file}'.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

def test_prepare_data():
    # Create a sample CSV file for testing (you can replace this with your own data)
    sample_data = {
        'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'],
        'Value': [10, None, 20]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)

    # Save the sample data to an input file
    input_file = 'sample_input_data.csv'
    df.to_csv(input_file, index=False)

    # Test data preparation
    output_file = 'prepared_data.csv'
    prepare_data(input_file, output_file)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Test the prepare_data function
    test_prepare_data()
```
Data preparation is an essential step in data analysis, and adherence to best practices guarantees the cleanliness, proper structure, and analysis readiness of your data. Here is an example of a Python automation script for data preparation that incorporates best practices. It is recommended to integrate this code with your specific data and requirements.

```python
import pandas as pd

def data_preparation(input_file, output_file):
    try:
        # Read the input data into a DataFrame
        data = pd.read_csv(input_file)

        # Data cleaning and transformation
        # Example 1: Handling missing values by filling them with the mean of the column
        data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

        # Example 2: Removing duplicates
        data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

        # Example 3: Data type conversion (e.g., converting a date column)
        data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

        # Data organization
        # Example: Sorting data by a specific column
        data.sort_values(by='Date', inplace=True)

        # Save the prepared data to an output file (e.g., CSV)
        data.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

        print(f"Data preparation completed. Prepared data saved as '{output_file}'.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace these with your input and output file paths
    input_file = 'input_data.csv'
    output_file = 'prepared_data.csv'

    # Perform data preparation
    data_preparation(input_file, output_file)
```
Several best practices have been incorporated in this script:
1. Handling Missing Values: The fillna method is employed to replace missing values with the column's mean, a widely adopted strategy for numerical data imputation. The adaptation of this approach can be customized to suit the specific data type and requirements of the user.
2. Elimination of Duplicates: In order to ensure accurate analysis results, the drop_duplicates function is employed to remove any duplicate entries.
3. Data Type Conversion: The conversion of a date column to a datetime format is performed using the pd.to_datetime function, which is crucial when handling date-based data.
4. Data Organization: The data is sorted according to a designated column, such as 'Date', in order to facilitate its organization for subsequent analysis.
5. Error Handling: Error handling has been implemented to capture and report any exceptions that may arise during the process of data preparation.
6. Input and Output File Paths: Substituting 'input_data.csv' and 'prepared_data.csv' with the paths to the respective actual input and output files is recommended.
To utilize this script, substitute the file paths of the input and output files with the respective paths of your data files, and execute the script. The system will execute data preparation and store the prepared data as specified.
The data cleaning and transformation steps should be customized according to the specific dataset and analysis requirements.

## 5. Data integration 

To develop an efficient Python automation script for data integration from Amazon Redshift to a CSV file on a local drive, the psycopg2 library can be utilized for establishing a connection with Redshift, while pandas can be employed for data manipulation.
To ensure accuracy, here is a script with a test function:

```python
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

def redshift_to_csv(host, port, database, user, password, query, output_csv):
    try:
        # Connect to Amazon Redshift
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            host=host,
            port=port,
            database=database,
            user=user,
            password=password
        )

        # Execute the SQL query and fetch data into a DataFrame
        df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

        # Save the DataFrame as a CSV file
        df.to_csv(output_csv, index=False)

        print(f"Data from Redshift successfully exported to '{output_csv}'.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

    finally:
        # Close the database connection
        if conn:
            conn.close()

def test_redshift_to_csv():
    # Replace with your Redshift server details, query, and desired output file path
    host = "your_redshift_host"
    port = "your_redshift_port"
    database = "your_redshift_database"
    user = "your_redshift_user"
    password = "your_redshift_password"
    query = "SELECT * FROM your_redshift_table"
    output_csv = "output_data.csv"

    # Test the data integration
    redshift_to_csv(host, port, database, user, password, query, output_csv)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test the redshift_to_csv function
    test_redshift_to_csv()
```

In the script above:
1. The redshift_to_csv function is defined to establish a connection with the Amazon Redshift database, execute the provided SQL query, and retrieve the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. The DataFrame's to_csv method then stores the data locally as a CSV file.
3. Error handling is implemented in order to capture and report any exceptions that may occur during the process.
4. We offer a test_redshift_to_csv function for the purpose of testing data integration. Substitute the placeholders with the specific Redshift server details, query, and the desired output CSV file path.

To use the script:
1. Substitute the placeholders in the test_redshift_to_csv function with the specific details of your Redshift server, query, and the desired file path for storing the resulting CSV file.
2. Execute the script. The system will establish a connection with the Redshift database, retrieve the data, and store it locally as a CSV file. Additionally, a success message will be displayed.
Ensure that the psycopg2 and pandas libraries are installed by executing the command "pip install psycopg2 pandas" prior to running the script.
