# Risk Portfolio Management System with Django

The Risk Portfolio Management System is a web-based application built using the Python Django framework. It provides users with a comprehensive platform to manage their investment portfolios, assess risks associated with assets, track transactions, and do portfolio analysis. The technology enables users to make informed investing decisions by offering important insights into their portfolio's risk exposure and performance.

### The system includes the following key features:
1.	User Management:
-	User registration and authentication.
-	User profile management.
-	Secure password handling.
2.	Portfolio Management:
-	Creation of multiple portfolios.
-	Portfolio modification and deletion.
-	Portfolio listing and detailed view.
-	Association of portfolios with respective users.
3.	Asset Management:
-	Addition of assets to portfolios.
-	Asset details view including name, ticker symbol, quantity, and purchase price.
-	Asset modification and deletion.
4.	Risk Assessment:
-	Addition of risks associated with assets.
-	Risk types classification (e.g., low, medium, high).
-	Risk severity assessment.
-	Risk description and details view.
5.	Transaction Tracking:
-	Recording of asset transactions (buy or sell).
-	Transaction details view including type, date, quantity, and price.
6.	Portfolio Analysis:
-	Calculation of portfolio performance metrics (e.g., returns, volatility).
-	Risk diversification analysis.
-	Graphical representation of portfolio performance.
7.	Security and Authentication:

# The RPMs framework

**1. Models:**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class Portfolio(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


class Asset(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    ticker_symbol = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    quantity = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    purchase_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    portfolio = models.ForeignKey(Portfolio, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


class Risk(models.Model):
    RISK_TYPES = [
        ('Low', 'Low'),
        ('Medium', 'Medium'),
        ('High', 'High'),
    ]
    risk_type = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=RISK_TYPES)
    description = models.TextField()
    severity = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    asset = models.ForeignKey(Asset, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


class Transaction(models.Model):
    TRANSACTION_TYPES = [
        ('Buy', 'Buy'),
        ('Sell', 'Sell'),
    ]
    transaction_type = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=TRANSACTION_TYPES)
    date = models.DateField()
    quantity = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    asset = models.ForeignKey(Asset, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

**2. Views and URL Routing:**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('portfolios/', views.PortfolioListView.as_view(), name='portfolio_list'),
    path('portfolios/create/', views.PortfolioCreateView.as_view(), name='portfolio_create'),
    path('portfolios/<int:pk>/', views.PortfolioDetailView.as_view(), name='portfolio_detail'),
    path('assets/<int:pk>/', views.AssetDetailView.as_view(), name='asset_detail'),
    path('assets/<int:pk>/risks/create/', views.RiskCreateView.as_view(), name='risk_create'),
    path('assets/<int:pk>/transactions/create/', views.TransactionCreateView.as_view(), name='transaction_create'),
]
```

**3. Views Implementation:**

```python
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView, CreateView
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from .models import Portfolio, Asset, Risk, Transaction


class PortfolioListView(LoginRequiredMixin, ListView):
    model = Portfolio
    template_name = 'portfolio_list.html'
    context_object_name = 'portfolios'

    def get_queryset(self):
        return Portfolio.objects.filter(user=self.request.user)


class PortfolioCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    model = Portfolio
    template_name = 'portfolio_create.html'
    fields = ['name', 'description']
    success_url = reverse_lazy('portfolio_list')

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.user = self.request.user
        return super().form_valid(form)


class PortfolioDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, DetailView):
    model = Portfolio
    template_name = 'portfolio_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'portfolio'


class AssetDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, DetailView):
    model = Asset
    template_name = 'asset_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'asset'


class RiskCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    model = Risk
    template_name = 'risk_create.html'
    fields = ['risk_type', 'description', 'severity']

    def form_valid(self, form):
        asset_id = self.kwargs['pk']
        asset =

 Asset.objects.get(pk=asset_id)
        form.instance.asset = asset
        return super().form_valid(form)

    def get_success_url(self):
        asset_id = self.kwargs['pk']
        return reverse_lazy('asset_detail', kwargs={'pk': asset_id})


class TransactionCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    model = Transaction
    template_name = 'transaction_create.html'
    fields = ['transaction_type', 'date', 'quantity', 'price']

    def form_valid(self, form):
        asset_id = self.kwargs['pk']
        asset = Asset.objects.get(pk=asset_id)
        form.instance.asset = asset
        return super().form_valid(form)

    def get_success_url(self):
        asset_id = self.kwargs['pk']
        return reverse_lazy('asset_detail', kwargs={'pk': asset_id})
```

**4. Templates:**

- `portfolio_list.html`: Display a list of user portfolios.
- `portfolio_create.html`: Form to create a new portfolio.
- `portfolio_detail.html`: Display detailed information about a portfolio, including its assets.
- `asset_detail.html`: Display detailed information about an asset, including its risks and transactions.
- `risk_create.html`: Form to create a new risk for an asset.
- `transaction_create.html`: Form to create a new transaction for an asset.

**5. Authentication and Authorization:**

- Implement Django's built-in authentication system to handle user registration, login, and session management.
- Utilize Django's authorization mechanisms to ensure users can only access and modify their own portfolios, assets, risks, and transactions.

**6. Business Logic and Calculations:**

- Implement necessary logic and calculations for risk assessment, portfolio analysis, and other relevant calculations within appropriate views or helper functions.

**7. Testing:**

- Write unit tests using Django's testing framework or a third-party testing library like pytest to verify the functionality and reliability of the system.

**8. Deployment:**

- Deploy the Django application to a production environment.
- Utilize web servers like Nginx or Apache to serve the application.
- Consider using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for hosting and deployment.

## Notes

1.	The models.py file defines the database models for the Risk Portfolio Management System. It comprises models for Portfolio, Asset, Risk, and Transaction. Each model represents a table in the database and defines the fields and relationships between them.
2.	The urls.py file defines the URL routing for the different views in the system. Each URL pattern is mapped to a corresponding view class from the views.py file.
3.	The views.py file contains the implementation of the views for the Risk Portfolio Management System. These views handle requests, interact with the models, and render templates to display data or receive user input. The views are built as Django's class-based views, which provide a straightforward way to organize and reuse code.
4.	The templates folder contains HTML templates that define the structure and layout of the web pages. Each template corresponds to a specific view and includes placeholders for dynamic data that is rendered by the Django templating engine.
5.	The authentication and authorization mechanisms of Django are used to handle user registration, login, and session management. Users can only access and modify their own portfolios, assets, risks, and transactions, ensuring data privacy and security.
6.	Business logic and calculations specific to risk assessment and portfolio analysis can be implemented within the views or helper functions. These calculations can involve risk types, severity assessments, portfolio performance metrics, and other relevant calculations.
7.	Unit tests can be written to ensure the functionality and reliability of the system. Django's testing framework or third-party libraries like pytest can be used to write and run these tests.
8.	Deployment involves hosting the Django application in a production environment. Web servers like Nginx or Apache can be used to serve the application, and platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean can be utilized for hosting and deployment.
