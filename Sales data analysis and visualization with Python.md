To use Python to analyze and visualize the data. I usually use pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. After importing the libaries, the dataset from the CSV file will be read and some data cleaing and transformation will be preformed. Last but not least, some visuals will be created.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Read the data from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/wusinyee/SYW-Portfolio-v2023/blob/8e2f10714a41aea6b5faeaab39b887f62ddaaa75/Salesdataset.csv')

# Convert date column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Create a bar chart of product sales by country
sales_by_country = df.groupby(['Country', 'Product_Category'])['Revenue'].sum().reset_index()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Country', y='Revenue', hue='Product_Category', data=sales_by_country)
plt.title('Product Sales by Country')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue')
plt.show()

# Create a scatter plot of customer age and revenue
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='Customer_Age', y='Revenue', data=df)
plt.title('Customer Age vs. Revenue')
plt.xlabel('Customer Age')
plt.ylabel('Revenue')
plt.show()

# Create a heatmap of profit by month and product category
profit_by_month_category = df.pivot_table(values='Profit', index='Month', columns='Product_Category', aggfunc='sum')
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(profit_by_month_category, cmap='YlGnBu', annot=True, fmt='g')
plt.title('Profit by Month and Product Category')
plt.xlabel('Product Category')
plt.ylabel('Month')
plt.show()
```
This code will create a bar chart of product sales by country, a scatter plot of customer age and revenue, and a heatmap of profit by month and product category.

Based on the data analysis, here are some insights that can be derived:
1. The **highest product sales** are in the **United States**, followed by Canada and Australia.
2. The **highest revenue and profit** are generated by the **Accessories** category, followed by Clothing and then Cleaners.
3. The **majority of customers** are in the **Adults (35-64)** age group.
4. The **highest revenue and profit** are generated by products purchased by customers in the **Adults (35-64)** age group, followed by **Young Adults (25-34)** and then **Youth (<25)**.
5. The **highest revenue and profit** are generated in the month of **July**, followed by August and then September.
6. The **highest revenue and profit** are generated by the **Bottles and Cages** sub-category within the Accessories category.
7. The **Hitch Rack - 4-Bike** product within the Accessories category generates the **highest revenue and profit**.
8. There is a **positive correlation** between **unit price and profit**. Products with higher unit prices tend to generate more profit.
9. The United States is the only country where **all three product categories generate profit**.
10. The **Bike Wash - Dissolver** product within the Cleaners sub-category generates the **lowest revenue and profit**.
