c. Prioritize Data Issues: Prioritize data quality issues based on their impact on critical business processes and decision-making.

d. Visualize Data Quality Metrics: Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that presents data quality metrics and visualizations to monitor trends and identify areas requiring improvement.

e. Enable Data Governance: Establish data governance processes to ensure ongoing data quality monitoring and remediation.

Project Scope:
The scope of the Data Quality Assessment Dashboard project includes the following:

a. Data Analysis: Perform a comprehensive analysis of existing data sources to identify potential data quality issues and define key metrics for assessment.

b. Dashboard Design and Development: Design and develop a user-friendly and intuitive dashboard that presents data quality metrics and visualizations.

c. Data Quality Assessment Framework: Develop a framework for assessing data quality, including data profiling, data cleansing, and data validation techniques.

d. Integration: Integrate the Data Quality Assessment Dashboard with existing data systems, including databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

e. Data Governance Implementation: Define and implement data governance processes to ensure continuous data quality monitoring and remediation.

f. Training and Documentation: Provide training sessions for users to effectively utilize the Data Quality Assessment Dashboard. Create comprehensive documentation for future reference.
