Data quality assessment metrics are measurements used to evaluate the quality of data. These metrics help assess various aspects of data quality, such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and validity. Here are commonly used data quality assessment metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the extent to which data values correspond to the true or expected values. Metrics include:

Error rate: Percentage of incorrect or inconsistent data values.
Validity rate: Percentage of data values that meet predefined validation rules.
Precision: Degree of closeness between the measured value and the true value.
Completeness: Measures the extent to which all required data elements are present. Metrics include:

Missing values: Percentage of missing data elements.
Completeness rate: Percentage of data records or fields that are complete.
Consistency: Measures the degree of coherence and conformity among data elements. Metrics include:

Inconsistency rate: Percentage of data elements that exhibit conflicting or contradictory values.
Redundancy: Presence of duplicate or redundant data elements.
Timeliness: Measures the currency and relevance of data in relation to the desired timeframe. Metrics include:

Latency: Time delay between data creation or capture and availability for analysis.
Age of data: Period between data capture and current date.
Validity: Measures the adherence of data to predefined business rules and constraints. Metrics include:

Conformity rate: Percentage of data values that conform to predefined validation rules.
Rule violations: Number or percentage of data values that violate predefined business rules.
Uniqueness: Measures the presence of duplicate or redundant data records or values. Metrics include:

Duplicate records: Number or percentage of records that have identical or highly similar attributes.
Unique values: Number or percentage of distinct values within a specific data field.
Integrity: Measures the accuracy and consistency of relationships and dependencies among data elements. Metrics include:

Referential integrity violations: Number or percentage of data records with broken or inconsistent relationships.
It's important to note that the specific data quality assessment metrics used may vary depending on the nature of the data, industry requirements, and organizational goals. Customization and alignment of metrics to specific business needs are crucial for an effective data quality assessment.

Principle: The primary principle of writing a Data Quality Dashboard technical specification is to establish clear and concise guidelines for measuring and monitoring the quality of data in an organization. The specification should outline the metrics to be used for measuring data quality, the sources of data, and the frequency of data collection. The dashboard should be designed to provide real-time insights into the quality of data, highlighting areas of concern and enabling corrective action to be taken promptly.

Application: To write a Data Quality Dashboard technical specification, the first step is to define the data quality metrics that will be used to evaluate the quality of data. These metrics may include completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, and validity. The sources of data should also be identified, along with the frequency of data collection. The dashboard should be designed to provide a graphical representation of the data quality metrics, allowing users to quickly identify areas of concern and take corrective action as needed.

The test plan for a Data Quality Dashboard should be designed to ensure that the dashboard is working as intended. The plan should include functional and usability testing, as well as regression testing to ensure that any changes made to the dashboard do not impact its functionality. The test plan should also include performance testing to ensure that the dashboard can handle high volumes of data and user traffic. Finally, user acceptance testing should be conducted to ensure that the dashboard meets the needs and expectations of its intended users. By following these principles and applications, a comprehensive Data Quality Dashboard technical specification and test plan can be developed to ensure the quality of data in an organization.
